By giving business owners the ability to send their customers personalized videos right to their cell phones is a huge opportunity that we believe is being missed. With TextJet we can let a merchant know that one of their customers had a poor experience. With TextJet, the merchant can send a personalized video apologizing for the experience and offering remedies to fix the issue. This is just one of the features that separate TextJet.</p>
